# Fictional Lakeside Health Inpatient Database and Crystal Reports Project
Showcasing my expertise in database design, SQL codes, and Crystal Reports development. This repository includes a fictional database schema designed by myself, synthetic data mostly generated by AI, complex queries and views, and professionally developed reports to demonstrate my ability to create efficient data solutions and insightful business reports. 

Please note all the data in this project are fictional. They were generated by AI Chatbots following my instructions, tailored and revised by myself.
